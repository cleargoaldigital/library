**What is Scope?**
Scope refers to the current context of your code. It can be globally or locally defined. Understanding scope helps developers write better, cleaner as well as understand where variables and functions are accessible and able to conveniently change the scope. It also helps in **debugging.**

*Global Scope*
The very first space into which a JS is first wriiten is called Global Scope. That is, when you first declare a variable, it is done in global scope.
